      question: "What is cryptocurrency?",
      answer: "Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a technology called blockchain. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat), cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized and operate on distributed ledger technology."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I start investing in crypto?",
      answer: "To start investing in cryptocurrency, you'll need to: 1) Choose a reputable exchange or platform, 2) Complete identity verification, 3) Connect a payment method, 4) Place your first order, and 5) Consider secure storage options like hardware wallets for larger investments. Start with small amounts while learning."
    },
    {
      question: "Is cryptocurrency safe?",
      answer: "Cryptocurrency safety has multiple dimensions. The blockchain technology behind most cryptocurrencies is generally secure, but there are risks associated with exchanges, wallets, market volatility, and scams. Using reputable exchanges, enabling two-factor authentication, and storing large amounts in hardware wallets can help mitigate some of these risks."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a crypto wallet?",
      answer: "A crypto wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Wallets contain private keys (secret codes) that prove your ownership of digital assets and allow you to authorize transactions. They come in various forms: software wallets (hot wallets) that are connected to the internet and hardware wallets (cold wallets) that are physical devices offering offline storage."
    },
    {
      question: "What are gas fees?",
      answer: "Gas fees are transaction fees paid to miners or validators who process transactions on blockchain networks like Ethereum. These fees compensate for the computational energy required to validate and add transactions to the blockchain. Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestionâ€”when more people are using the network, fees typically increase."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between coins and tokens?",
      answer: "Coins (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) operate on their own blockchain and typically function as a medium of exchange or store of value. Tokens are built on existing blockchains (most commonly Ethereum) and represent assets or utilities within specific applications or ecosystems. For example, tokens might represent voting rights, access to services, or ownership of digital or physical assets."
